# Build Classification Models to Predict the Onset of Diabetes Based on Diagnostic Measures
Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
- Visualize the distribution and correlation of diagnostic measures and diabetes test results using Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python.<br>
- Develop logistic regression, SVM and random forest models to predict the onset of diabetes.<br>
- Apply GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for models. <br>
- Assess model performance (confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC AUC) and interpret performance from business impact viewpoint (false negatives vs false positives)
